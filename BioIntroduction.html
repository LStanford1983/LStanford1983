 is Lee Stanford?  Nobody of note just yet.  However, I fully intend to 
change that.  Hi, yes, I am Lee Stanford and I recently completed the 
Linux System Engineer: Networking and SSH course on LinkedIn.  I am 
running a few Fedora machines, a few Windows machines, and a Mac.  My 
network isn't really big yet but that is going to change too.</p>

<p>Right now, I am studying scripting in HTML, Python, Bash, and 
PowerShell.  I have varied interests in Blockchain Technology...on 
several blockchains and intend to move my studies more in that direction
 at some point soon.  I already have a bit of experience with the 
wonderful world of DeFi, such as it is at the time of this writing (see 
"Crypto Bear Market of 2022" which I am sure they will write about 
someday).  I have some experience with NFT's on various blockchains.  I 
am just a crypto and NFT enthusiast, who happens to be studying some 
prgramming languages and getting into SSH/SFTP and networking.  Don't be
 fooled though, I can see some parallels and similarities between 
Computer Networking and Blockchain Technology.  The similarities between
 SSH/GPG/SFTP Cryptography and Blockchain Cryptography on-chain 
fascinates me and I don't know why</p>

<p>So what are some of my ambitions, you might ask.  Well, at present I 
have a small residential home network that I am trying to pump money 
into and expand.  Once I get the network to a certain size, and to 
include certain devices and protocols, my hopeful ambition is to start, 
run, and maintain an ISP and Gaming Network that provides subscriptions 
for profit. I want my network to become a Regional ISP, to be like 
GameStop and Verizon had a love child.  I'm still a long way away from 
that, but that is where my network mania is headed.  I also want to 
develop some apps for people's phones because with Portable Computing 
even your cell phone can connect to my network.  </p>

<p>As for any ambitions that I have in the crypto world I would love to 
get to a place where I could script in just about anything as I have a 
few ideas for apps that I woulnd't mind developing...Yes, I'm also 
headed toward Solidity Programming.  Like a deer in the headlights, I 
see it coming...THE FUTURE OF FINANCE, A WORLD WITHOUT GREEDY BANKS THAT
 CHARGE FEES THAT KEEP PEOPLE IN POVERTY! A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE MANAGE 
THEIR OWN MONETARY POLICY.</p>

<p>I see the potential in Blockchain Technology to eliminate banks 
entirely and putting society on a course correction away from poverty, 
but that is only one potential that I see there.  I also see the 
potential of Blockchain Technology to revolutionize and make more 
efficient, a lot of other industries beyound Finance!  I think that 
Blockchain Technology could improve Law records, eliminating trageties 
like Courthouse and Legal Records being destroyed by fire.  I see 
Blockchain Technology making Construction Contracting more transparent 
and fair.  I see Blockchain Technology vastly improving the efficiency 
of the Internal Revenue Service someday (I hope that someone at that 
time remembers how the IRS loathed and railed against crypto in the 
beginning).  I see Blockchain Technology improving GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY
 at a Federal Level, all the way down to local County Communities
